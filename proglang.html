<h1>Program Terms</h1>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Machine Language:</strong> A low-level programming language consisting of binary code that a computer's central processing unit (CPU) can directly execute.</li>
    <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> The process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in a computer program.</li>
    <li><strong>Assembler:</strong> A program that translates assembly language into machine code.</li>
    <li><strong>Assembly Language:</strong> A low-level programming language that is a human-readable representation of machine language.</li>
    <li><strong>Translator:</strong> A program that converts source code from one programming language to another.</li>
    <li><strong>Compiler:</strong> A type of translator that translates the entire source code of a program into machine code before execution.</li>
    <li><strong>Interpreter:</strong> A type of translator that translates and executes source code line by line.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross Platform System:</strong> A system or software that can run on different types of computer platforms.</li>
    <li><strong>Natural Language:</strong> A human language used for communication, such as English or Spanish.</li>
    <li><strong>Formal Language:</strong> A language with a specific set of rules and syntax, often used in programming.</li>
    <li><strong>Machine Independence:</strong> The ability of a program to run on different types of machines without modification.</li>
    <li><strong>High-Level Programming Language:</strong> A programming language that is closer to human language and abstracts away low-level details.</li>
    <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming:</strong> A programming paradigm that uses objects and classes for organizing code.</li>
    <li><strong>Scripting Language:</strong> A lightweight programming language often used for automation and scripting tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Type:</strong> A classification of data that determines the type of operations that can be performed on it.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Float</li>
        <li>Integer</li>
        <li>String</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Primitive Data Type:</strong> A basic data type that is not composed of other data types.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Structure:</strong> A way of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>Python Collection Data Structures:</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>List</li>
        <li>Tuple</li>
        <li>Set</li>
        <li>Dictionary</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Function:</strong> A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Variable:</strong> A variable that is declared within a specific block of code and is only accessible within that block.</li>
    <li><strong>Global Variable:</strong> A variable that is declared outside of any specific block of code and is accessible throughout the program.</li>
    <li><strong>Source Program:</strong> The original program written by the programmer.</li>
    <li><strong>Object Program:</strong> The machine code generated by a compiler or assembler from the source program.</li>
</ul>
