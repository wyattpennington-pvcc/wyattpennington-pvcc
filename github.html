    <title>Version Control and GitHub</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Version Control System (VCS)</h1>
    <p>A version control system (VCS) is a tool that helps manage changes to source code over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, track changes, and revert to previous versions if needed.</p>

    <h1>Git</h1>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.</p>

    <h1>GitHub</h1>
    <p>GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development using Git. It includes features like code collaboration, bug tracking, and more.</p>

    <h1>Difference between Git and GitHub</h1>
    <p>Git is the version control system, while GitHub is a platform that uses Git for version control. Git is used locally on a developer's machine, while GitHub is a remote repository hosting service.</p>

    <h1>GitHub Founder and History</h1>
    <p>GitHub was founded by Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, and Tom Preston-Werner in 2008. It started as a way to simplify sharing code and collaborating on software development projects.</p>

    <h1>Current Owner of GitHub</h1>
    <p>As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, GitHub was owned by Microsoft. Please verify for the latest information.</p>

    <h1>Octocat</h1>
    <p>The Octocat is the mascot of GitHub. It's a cute, cat-like creature with octopus tentacles, often used in GitHub branding and promotional material.</p>

    <h1>Git/GitHub Terms</h1>

    <h2>Repository</h2>
    <p>A repository (repo) is a location where all the files for a particular project are stored, along with the version history of those files.</p>

    <h2>Commit</h2>
    <p>A commit is a snapshot of the changes made to a repository. It represents a specific point in the project's history and includes a message describing the changes.</p>

    <h2>Fork</h2>
    <p>Forking a repository means creating a personal copy of someone else's project. It allows you to make changes without affecting the original project, and you can later propose those changes back to the original repository.</p>

    <h2>Push</h2>
    <p>Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository. It's a way to share your work with others or update the central repository.</p>

    <h2>Pull Requests</h2>
    <p>A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository. It allows others to review and discuss the changes before they are merged into the main project.</p>

    <h2>Workflows</h2>
    <p>Workflows in the context of Git/GitHub refer to the defined set of rules or processes that dictate how code changes move from development through testing and eventually to deployment.</p>

    <h2>Issues</h2>
    <p>Issues are a way to track tasks, enhancements, bugs, or other kinds of questions within a repository. They can be used for collaboration, discussion, and project management.</p>

    <h2>Raw Button</h2>
    <p>The Raw button allows you to view the raw content of a file in its original format, without any formatting applied. It's useful when you need to directly access the file's raw data.</p>

    <h2>Blame Button</h2>
    <p>The Blame button, often found in version control systems, shows the revision and author of each line in a file. It helps identify who last modified a particular piece of code.</p>
